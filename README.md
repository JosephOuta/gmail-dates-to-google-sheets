# gmail-dates-to-google-sheets

This script will let you start with a list of emails on Google Sheets, look them up on Gmail to pull the last date you emailed said accounts, and store those dates in a new column on the same spreadsheet.

## How to use
The cell references need to be adapted for your particular use case. The script also needs some cleaning up. Will post updates shortly on how to use it. Its pretty straightforward if you're already familiar with Apps Script.
